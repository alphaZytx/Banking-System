# Banking Application

A comprehensive **Banking Application** implemented in **Java**, demonstrating advanced software engineering principles, including **OOP**, **Design Patterns**, **Multithreading**, and **Persistent Storage**.

---

## 🚀 **Features**

- **Account Management:** Create, view, search, and close accounts.
- **Transaction Operations:** Deposit, withdraw, transfer funds, and view transaction history.
- **Support for Multiple Account Types:** Savings, Current, and Fixed Deposit accounts, each with specific rules.
- **Interest Calculation:** Automated interest processing for eligible accounts.
- **Multithreading:** Asynchronous transaction processing using **ExecutorService**.
- **Design Patterns:** Implements **Factory**, **Command**, and **Observer** patterns.
- **Data Persistence:** Saves and loads banking data using **Serialization**.
- **Robust UI:** Interactive console-based interface with enhanced visual formatting.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- **Java** (Core, Collections, Concurrency)
- **Serialization** for persistent storage
- **Design Patterns:** Factory, Command, Observer
- **Multithreading:** **ExecutorService** with a fixed thread pool

## 🚦 **Setup and Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 8 or later
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/letsbegincode/Banking-System
cd Banking-System
```

### **Compile the Application**
```bash
cd src
javac *.java
```

### **Run the Application**
```bash
java BankingApplication
```

### **Data Persistence**
- On exit, the application automatically saves data to `banking_system.ser`.
- On startup, it attempts to load existing data from this file.

---

## 🧠 **Design Patterns Implemented**

- **Factory Pattern:** Simplifies account creation (`AccountFactory`).
- **Command Pattern:** Encapsulates account operations (`DepositOperation`, `WithdrawOperation`, `TransferOperation`).
- **Observer Pattern:** Provides notifications (`ConsoleNotifier`, `TransactionLogger`).

---

## 👨‍💻 **Usage Guide**

1. **Create an Account:** Supports Savings, Current, and Fixed Deposit types.
2. **Perform Transactions:** Deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds securely.
3. **Generate Reports:** View account summaries and transaction volumes.
4. **Process Interest:** Automatically calculates and applies interest to eligible accounts.

---

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

- **Class Not Found Error:** Ensure `.class` files are in the correct directory.
- **Serialization Issues:** Delete `banking_system.ser` if data corruption occurs.
- **Multithreading Deadlock:** Review the `operationQueue` processing logic.

---

## 💡 **Future Enhancements**

- **GUI Integration:** Build a desktop application using **JavaFX** or **Swing**.
- **RESTful API:** Create a backend server to support web or mobile frontends.
- **Database Support:** Replace serialization with **JDBC** and **MySQL** for data persistence.

---

## 🛡️ **Security Considerations**

- Input validation to avoid invalid transactions.
- Thread safety in multithreaded operations.
- Exception handling to prevent application crashes.
